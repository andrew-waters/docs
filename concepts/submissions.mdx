Submissions are completed forms that are sent to Ctrl Hub.

## Forms

Forms can contain many different types of data as _fields_.

## Fields

A _field_ represents a unit of input (such as text, or an image) that makes up a _form_, which is eventually _submitted_.

Fields are the data you want to capture, whereas _forms_ are how these fields are put together in a format which makes it easy to complete.

### Field Types

 - Checkbox
