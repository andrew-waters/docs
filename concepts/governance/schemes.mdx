__Schemes__ in Ctrl Hub are shorthand for schemes of work. A scheme is a larger programme of work that is broken down into smaller __Work Orders__. You can have many schemes in Ctrl Hub.

A single scheme can contain one or more __Work Orders__, which usually (but not always) relate to the work that is required on a specific __street__ and the __properties__ on it. Not all properties need to have __operations__ carried out on them, but the scheme will contain all the properties that are affected by the work.

A scheme will usually have a __start date__ and an __end date__ which is the period of time that the work is expected to be carried out.

<Tip>
You can also create __categories__ to give you the ability to group schemes together. This can be useful if you have a large number of schemes and you want to be able to filter them using the language of your organisation.
</Tip>

Schemes may have [forms](/concepts/data-capture/forms) attached to them which can be completed by authorised personnel. As you will learn below, forms can also be attached to work orders - they make up part of the scheme and the captured data can contribute to the overall status of the scheme.

<Info>
The scheme will also have a __status__ which is calculated using the completeness of the work orders it contains.

## Work Orders and Operations

As mentioned, Work Orders are the tasks that need to be carried out as part of a scheme. The specific work that needs to be done is called an __operation__. Each work order can contain one or more operations.

Generally speaking, operatives in the field will be assigned to work orders and will complete the operations that are contained within them. When all the operations in a work order are complete, the work order will be marked as complete.

Data that needs to be captured as part of the work order is configured by attaching [forms](/concepts/data-capture/forms) to the work order. These forms can be filled in by the operative in the field and will be stored against the work order.

<Info>
A work order will also have a __status__ which is calculated using the completeness of the operations it contains.
