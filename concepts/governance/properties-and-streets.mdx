Ctrl Hub offer data endpoints for geospatial data. This allows you to perform queries that can be displayed on a map, or within a gepgraphical boundary.

We currently offer both property and street data in the UK. You can read more about the standards (UPRN and USRN) [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/identifying-property-and-street-information).

## Properties

Properties in Ctrl Hub are identified using their UPRN. The term "properties" is wide - it is not just domestic and commerical buildings, the dataset includes bus stops, substations, and other infrastructure.

Properties have a fixed coordinate.

[View the API Model](/api-reference/governance/properties/model).

## Streets

Streets in Ctrl Hub are identified using their USRN. Unlike properties, streets are multi line coordinates. This is because streets are not a single point, nor are they a straight line.
