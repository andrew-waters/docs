When submission data is sent to Ctrl Hub via forms, the data in the submission is processed and stored. Customers often have additional (and different) data which they need to capture and store. This is where processors come in. They extract the core data from the submission and store it in a way that is optimal for querying and reporting.

Of course, the data from the additional fields in the forms is persisted, but this extraction allows Ctrl Hub to provide a more efficient way to access the core data.

The processors which handle the data can then be queried to retrieve the data relative to the processing domain. For example, forms which are designed to capture _reinstatements_ will have the data extracted and stored in an optimal way where querying the data via the API, running reports and managing organisational risk can be be performed.

The diagram above shows the flow of data from a submission being completed in the field to being able to view that in the Ctrl Hub application. To read more about the types of processors available, use the sidebar to take a look at the fields and rationale of each one.
