<Tip>
  [Bounded Boxes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bounding_box) allow you to search for properties within a specific area. This is useful for finding properties within a specific area, usually to display on a map.

  To search for properties within a bounded box, you need to supply two pieces of data with the request: the top right and bottom left coordinates of the box.

  The API will then return a list of properties that fall within the box that can be drawn from those two coordinates.
