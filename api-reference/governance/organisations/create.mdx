title: 'Create an Organisation'
openapi: 'POST /v3/orgs'
---

<Warning>
    Once an organisation has been created, the API will create a unique slug for you.
    This is derived from the organisation name, which is lowercased and all non alpha numeric characters are replaced with a dash (`-`).

    **Once an organisation has been created, the slug becomes immutable - even if the organisation name changes in the future.**.
</Warning>

The API will handle some of the attributes for the Organisation when it is created - `attributes.slug`, `meta.created_at`, `meta.status` and `relationships.owners` are all generated by the API.

You cannot change owners until at creation time and only an owner can add other owners.
If you do want to add other owners, make sure you use credentials for the same actor that you used for the create request.
