title: 'Get Stats'
openapi: 'GET /v3/orgs/{orgId}/data-capture/forms/stats'

This endpoint returns submission counts for this form within the time bound range that you specify in the filter. Calling this endpoint means you **must** send **both** the `filter[created_at.since]` and `filter[created_at.until]` parameters.

<Note>
  You can choose a granularity for the response data. Make sure that you pick one that is appropriate to the time bounds you request. It is likely that in the future, we will prevent too many buckets being returned based on the bounds.

  For example, if you are retrieving stats from 1st June to the 30th June, `daily` is a good granularity.
