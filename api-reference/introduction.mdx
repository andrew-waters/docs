## Welcome

Welcome to the API Reference. As we start building out our new API, we will be adding more endpoints to these pages.
Below are some of the goals of the API.

<Note>
  This documentation is exclusively for the new set of APIs.
  If you have an existing integration, you should refer to the documentation you have previously used.
  When you are ready to transition to the new APIs, use this reference.
</Note>

### Consistency

Our API adopts the [json:api](https://jsonapi.org) specification. This is a RESTful interface which allows you to integrate easily and gives you a consistent experience across the entire surface of our endpoints.

We strongly recommend that you take a look over the specification directly, even if briefly, before integrating.

### Coverage

We build our own tooling and applications exclusively from the API - any features you see available in our dashboard or mobile application are powered with the same endpoints.
Therefore you can expect to be able to integrate with any data you see in Ctrl Hub.

### Performance

The API is designed to be as performant as possible. Because we power our own applications with the same APIs you integrate with, we see first hand where there are improvements that can be made.

By adopting json:api we also increase performance on the wire, by giving you control, as a caller, to only fetch the data you need and to only include the related resources that are relevant to your request.
