<Update label="2024-11-01">
  - We are now capturing form submissions from the current version in the new services. This is going to allow us to provide access to submission data more efficiently.
</Update>


<Update label="2024-10-22">
  - It is now possible to create Service Accounts using the [API](/api-reference/admin/iam/service-accounts/model) and via the dashboard.
  - We are migrating user accounts from v2 to v3. These will remain backwards compatible, so you can log in to both platforms with the same credentials.
</Update>
