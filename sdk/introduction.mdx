An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of software tools and libraries that developers use to create applications. At Ctrl Hub, we provide as many SDKs as possible to help you integrate our services into your applications.

All of the SDKs are [built on top of our API](/api-reference), which means you can use the SDKs to interact with the API in a more convenient way and you have more choice over the integration that you want.

We license all of our SDKs under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit), which means you can use them in your applications without any restrictions.
