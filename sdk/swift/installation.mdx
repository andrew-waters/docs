## Installing the Package

Swift offers a variety of ways to install packages. We fully support the [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/).

You can add the package using the `https://github.com/ctrl-hub/sdk.swift` URL.

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through a `CtrlHubConfig.plist` file, which you should add to the root of your own project:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>authDomain</key>
    <string>https://auth.ctrl-hub.com</string>
    <key>apiDomain</key>
    <string>https://api.ctrl-hub.com</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

You should then instantiate the config in your own application with the following code:

```swift
import CtrlHub

// Read the configuration from the CtrlHubConfig.plist in your app bundle:
if let configuration = CtrlHub.Config() {
    CtrlHub.config = configuration
} else {
    // there are errors in the config file that you should handle
}
```
