Once installed as a package in your project, you can import the package into each file in your project that needs access to the Ctrl Hub API, using the standard Swift import statement:

```swift
import CtrlHub
```

You are now able to start calling the API with an access token.

<Warning>We will add some documentation about the Access Tokens soon</Warning>

## Asking for Resources

The access pattern for calling resources is intended to be consistent. It follows the format `CtrlHub.Resource.Method()`

```swift
let _ = CtrlHub.Organisations.Get() { response in
    // handle the response
}
```

The `response` should be checked in your code, and we either mark it a success or a fail.

```swift
let _ = CtrlHub.Organisations.Get() { response in
    switch response {
        case .Success(let data):
            debugPrint(data) // data will be an array of organisations the user has access to
        case .Fail(let error):
            print("an error occurred:", error)
        }
    }
}
```
